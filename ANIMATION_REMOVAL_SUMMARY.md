## Benefits

1. **Performance Improvement**: Reduced bundle size and runtime animations
2. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex animation logic
3. **Better Accessibility**: Reduced motion for users with vestibular disorders
4. **Faster Loading**: No animation delays on form rendering
5. **Consistent Experience**: Standardized form behavior across all pages

## Files Not Modified

The following files still contain animations but were not form-related:
- Landing page animations (marketing content)
- Dashboard layout animations (navigation)
- Student dashboard animations (display content)
- Component library animations (UI components)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all form submissions work correctly
2. Verify loading states display properly
3. Check that form validation still works
4. Ensure responsive design is maintained
5. Test accessibility with screen readers
